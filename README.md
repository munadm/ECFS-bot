FCC ECFS messenger bot for the "Restoring Electronic Freedom Proposal"
==========================================================
This is a simple facebook chat bot that allows the everyday facebook user to comment on the "Restoring Electronic Proposal"

Before you use this chat app I highly encourage you to read the proposal [here](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344614A1.pdf). The key takeaway from this is to revert broadband providers to the Title I designation of the 1934 Communications Act instead of the Title II that it currently occupies. One side argues that it will lead to sweeping deregulation of this market leading to consumer growth while the other argues the deregulation will cause the end of net neutrality that has been critical in the development for a fair market for tech companies.

Why does this exist?
-------
Currently, this is only at the stage known as NPRM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making) but it is at this point the public are allowed to post their opinions to the FCC. This process is done through the ECFS (Electronic Comment File System), which is, though fairly straightforward is not well-known. The objective of this bot is to make it easier for the denizens to communicate to the FCC about this proposal.
